# Errors

# Types of errors in Python:
    # 1. Syntax errors:
        # Misspellings, non-indented lines, wrong variable names, missing colons in statements or parentheses in functions.
        # Highlighted by red squiggling line (but not EVERY syntax error).
        # Basic, easy to fix
    # 2. Logic (semantic) errors:
        # Are errors that are not a result of syntax issues in your code.
        # Program works, but there is no logic in it, the result is wrong.
        # Not trivial, require time and mind to fix
    # 3. Runtime errors:
        # This errors crach the app
        # Reading a file that doesn't exist
        # Permission denied
        # Dividing by zero
        # Unlike syntax errors, exceptions are not always fatal. Exceptions can be handled with the use of a try statement
